## What?
A genre-mash circuit-building game that combines music with puzzles. Enemies arrive to the beat of a melody and your goal is to play this melody using a bunch of circuitry components.

## Gameplay
The core gameplay loop consists of building a circuit that can play a melody. The circuit is built on a grid and consists of components that can be unlocked by progressing through the campaign. Each component has a specific function, and by strategically connecting them, players can create complex circuits that play the required melody and eliminate enemy waves.

Components include:
- **Pulser**: Generates periodic pulses based on a time signature, serving as the main beat provider.
- **Wires**: Carry pulses. Single and bidirectional. Jumper wires can cross other wires without connecting.
- **Sequencer**: Sequentially activates the next output pin for each input pulse.
- **Counter**: Emits one output pulse after a defined number of input pulses. Useful for creating delays.

<Callout type="info" title="Upgrades" body="There is preparation for upgrades, which are supposed to be bought with in-game currency. Upgrades include controllable pulser rate, more output pins on sequencer etc." />

## Development
I was inspired to make this by games like [Infinifactory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/Infinifactory/). The development presented a lot of interesting challenges, including:
1. A system for representing circuits in a way that is flexible.
2. The logic for how pulses propagate through the circuit.
3. A system for enemies to spawn and move according to the beat, along with detecting correct and incorrect notes played.
4. A way to communicate the melody to be played visually.

### Common component interface
I created a common interface to represent the components and their connections, while providing enough flexibility to allow for a wide variety of component types. For generating the pulses, a global ticker was used to sync time steps across the level.

 which required careful consideration of timing and interactions between components.

 especially in terms of creating a user-friendly interface for building circuits and ensuring that the game mechanics were intuitive and engaging. I also had to implement a robust system for handling the timing of pulses and the interactions between different components.
