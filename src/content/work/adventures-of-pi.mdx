## What?
A genre-mash circuit-building game that combines music with puzzles. Enemies arrive to the beat of a melody and your goal is to play this melody using a bunch of circuitry components.

## Gameplay
The core gameplay loop consists of building a circuit that can play a melody. The circuit is built on a grid and consists of components that can be unlocked by progressing through the campaign. Each component has a specific function, and by strategically connecting them, players can create complex circuits that play the required melody and eliminate enemy waves.
